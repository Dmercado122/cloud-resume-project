# Cloud Resume Project

This is my cloud resume project, inspired by the Cloud Resume Challenge. It's a work in progress as I continue learning Google Cloud Platform.

## Goals:
- Deploy a personal resume site using GCP
- Practice working with Cloud Storage, IAM, and basic hosting
- Track progress toward Google Cloud certification

## Tech Stack:
- Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
- HTML / Static Hosting
- Markdown Documentation

## Project Screenshots
Screenshots of GCP configuration and deployment will be placed in the `screenshots/` folder.
